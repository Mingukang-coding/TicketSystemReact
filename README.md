## Project Overview

**For Non-Technical Readers**

This system works like a digital task board where managers can create work requests (tickets) and assign them to team members. Employees can see their assigned tasks, update progress, and communicate through work logs. The system automatically tracks deadlines, sends alerts for overdue items, and provides real-time updates so everyone stays informed about project status.

**For Technical Readers**: The application is built using React 18+ with functional components and hooks for state management. Redux Toolkit handles global state for tickets, users, and work logs, while React Router manages navigation between admin and employee dashboards. The UI is constructed with React Bootstrap components, ensuring responsive design across devices. LocalStorage provides data persistence, and the build process is optimised using Vite for fast development and efficient production builds.

### Future Roadmap

**Coming Soon**: Transforming this frontend solution into a full-stack powerhouse by integrating robust backend APIs and real-time database connectivity to deliver enterprise-grade scalability and performance!
